# Storage Setup Guide for DevDocs AI

This guide will help you set up the Supabase storage bucket that's required for DevDocs AI to function properly.

## The Problem

You're seeing this error in the debug output:
```
üì¶ Storage Bucket Check:
   ‚ùå api-docs bucket not found
   Available buckets: []
```

This means the `api-docs` storage bucket hasn't been created in your Supabase project yet.

## Solution: Manual Bucket Creation

Since Supabase storage buckets must be created through the dashboard (not via SQL or API), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Storage Bucket

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project at https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your DevDocs AI project

2. **Navigate to Storage**
   - Click on **Storage** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **Buckets**

3. **Create New Bucket**
   - Click **Create a new bucket**
   - Set the following:
     - **Name**: `api-docs` (exactly this name)
     - **Public bucket**: **UNCHECKED** (keep it private for security)
   - Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Set Up Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, you need to set up access policies:

1. **Go to Storage Policies**
   - In the Storage section, click on **Policies**
   - Select the `api-docs` bucket from the dropdown

2. **Create Upload Policy**
   - Click **New Policy**
   - Set the following:
     - **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated uploads`
     - **Allowed operation**: `INSERT`
     - **Target roles**: `authenticated`
     - **Policy definition**: `true`
   - Click **Review** then **Save policy**

3. **Create Download Policy**
   - Click **New Policy**
   - Set the following:
     - **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated downloads`
     - **Allowed operation**: `SELECT`
     - **Target roles**: `authenticated`
     - **Policy definition**: `true`
   - Click **Review** then **Save policy**

4. **Create Delete Policy**
   - Click **New Policy**
   - Set the following:
     - **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated deletes`
     - **Allowed operation**: `DELETE`
     - **Target roles**: `authenticated`
     - **Policy definition**: `true`
   - Click **Review** then **Save policy**

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run the storage setup script to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd backend
python simple_storage_setup.py
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ api-docs bucket found
‚úÖ Bucket access confirmed
```

## Alternative: Advanced Security Policies

If you want more granular security (recommended for production), use these policies instead:

### Policy 1: Upload Access
- **Name**: `Users can upload their own files`
- **Operation**: `INSERT`
- **Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Definition**: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

### Policy 2: Download Access
- **Name**: `Users can view their own files`
- **Operation**: `SELECT`
- **Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Definition**: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

### Policy 3: Delete Access
- **Name**: `Users can delete their own files`
- **Operation**: `DELETE`
- **Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Definition**: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "must be owner of table objects"

This error occurs when trying to run SQL commands on storage tables. **Solution**: Don't use SQL for storage setup. Use the Supabase dashboard instead.

### Error: "Bucket not found"

**Solution**: Make sure you created the bucket with the exact name `api-docs` (with the hyphen).

### Error: "Access denied"

**Solution**: Check that you've created the storage policies correctly and that your service role key has the necessary permissions.

### Error: "Policy creation failed"

**Solution**: Try the simpler policies first (`true` for all operations), then upgrade to more secure policies later.

## Testing the Setup

After setting up the storage bucket, test it by:

1. **Running the debug script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python debug_pipeline.py
   ```

2. **Uploading a test document** through the frontend

3. **Checking the storage bucket** in the Supabase dashboard to see if files appear

## Next Steps

Once the storage bucket is working:

1. ‚úÖ Storage bucket created
2. ‚úÖ Storage policies configured
3. ‚úÖ Debug script shows bucket access
4. ‚úÖ Document uploads work
5. ‚úÖ Document processing pipeline works

Your DevDocs AI application should now be fully functional!
